- Additions
    - Cobblemon - Added tags for pokeballs and consumables.

    - JeCobblemon - Added item tag, `tools` for JeCobblemon mod compatibilities.
- Changes
    - Utility Belt - Moved item ids and item tags of tools to `#jecobblemon:tools`, which in turn added to #c:tools, which is added on default to Utility Belt.
